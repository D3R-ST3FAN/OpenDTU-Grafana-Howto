# OpenDTU-Grafana-Howto

How to monitor openDTU (awesome project see: https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU) data in grafana. I have created this repo during setup of this on my debian server, hopefully it can help someone to do this faster.

**There is also a repo with the whole thing as docker stack:** https://github.com/Kraego/OpenDTU-Grafana-Stack

If you have any improvements or corrections, make an PR. Thanks.
